## Project 1: Interpret a Data Visualization


### Project description

A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. To give you some practice with this, we’ve selected a few Tableau dashboards for you to explore. The links are below, under "Choose from these Dashboards." Choose one of these dashboards, whichever one interests you the most, and find three insights in the visualizations. For each insight, provide a static image that shares what you found. Write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. Altogether (including images), your report should be 1-2 pages.

## Project 2: Analyze NYSE Data 
### Why this Project?
This project will introduce you to the data analysis process that you will be using throughout the rest of the Nanodegree program. In this project, you will go through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing an inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal is for you to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.

## Project 3: Predicting Diamond Prices

### Project Details
A diamond distributor has recently decided to exit the market and has put up a set of 3,000 diamonds up for auction. Seeing this as a great opportunity to expand its inventory, a jewelry company has shown interest in making a bid. To decide how much to bid, the company’s analytics team used a large database of diamond prices to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes. You, as the business analysts, are tasked to apply that model to make a recommendation for how much the company should bid for the entire set of 3,000 diamonds.

## Project 4: Build Data Dashboards

### Project Description
In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
